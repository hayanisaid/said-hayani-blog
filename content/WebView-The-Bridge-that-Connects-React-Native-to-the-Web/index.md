## WebView is the channel that connects React Native with Web platforms, giving us many great options to create a sort of connections to our app that is running on the¬†Web!

![](./asset-1.png)

Using `[**WebView**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview)` element has a many of advantages it can be used for embedding or running a web application inside our React Native app that‚Äôs good especially if you have a web app and you want to connect that app the with your React Native app or even get access to the other platforms (google maps ex).

for a better understanding of the use cases of `[**WebView**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview)`, we are going to build a WebView that can load a web page and control the navigation!

Tip: **Leverage components to build more modular software**. Use tools like [**Bit**](https://bit.dev) ([GitHub](https://github.com/teambit/bit)) to develop, share and reuse components between projects. It will help you build better applications faster alone or as a team, give it a try:

### Getting started

Let start first by creating a new React Native project, make sure that you have the environment to run a React Native app. I‚Äôm using [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) so all I need to do is to run the following command:

> **Note**: you don‚Äôt need to create a new react-native app, you can just see the code and see how the WebView works I will leave to source good on GitHub

```
react-native init webview-app
```

This will bootstrap the project and all the necessary files to start working with React native.

Now run `react-native run-ios` to install the app on ios simulator and `react-native run-android` for Android.

For me, I have everything set up so I don‚Äôt have to run everything.

#### Implementing the¬†WebView:

Note that `WebView` is an element of react-native that comes out of the box so no need for any extra configuration or installing any library so simply import it from **react-native**¬†:

```
import { WebView } from "react-native";
```

And use it as any other elements:

If you look at the screen it just now a blank screen!

And that‚Äôs because the WebView requires a source URL in order to work! so let‚Äôs add the URL, we use `**source**`  props to set the URL.

I used here twitter as URL, and this will load the Twitter home page in our app üòâ

![](./asset-3.png)

Actually, that‚Äôs super awesome just to be able to display a webpage inside your react-native app, and actually, you can use any other website as well, that‚Äôs mean also we have many options to control the WebView for example, handle the navigation.

### Control the¬†WebView

WebView, as we mentioned before, is just an element of react-native but there are options that let us do some tricks like even build a customized mini web browser Yeah!

#### Control the¬†Layout

WebView is just a View that we can style and add an element to it, so we are going to add a header Component that can contain some other components, for example, a `navbar` to control the navigation! so let‚Äôs do it!

And voila!!

![](./asset-4.png)

Super cool, now let‚Äôs add a footer! the footer can contain, for example, a TabNavigator and some buttons to take some actions like _goingBack_ and _goForward_!

The result¬†!!

![](./asset-5.png)

Until now üëç!

Let‚Äôs add actions to the buttons so when a button is clicked, for example, allow to the page to navigate back that gives us some control on the navigation history.

-   If I click left-arrow it should take me back to the previous page if there is any
-   If I click the right-arrow it should navigate me to the next page if there is any.

In order to have control and use WebView navigation history, we have to assign it a `ref` to trigger those two actions:

And yay!!

### Control the page¬†loading

Loading a page inside the WebView can be slow, and we want to display an indicator like a spinner to indicate to the user that the page is loading that gives the user a better experience. there are `onLoadStart` props that take a function that it‚Äôs called when the page starts loading and `onLoadEnd` that it‚Äôs called when the load end. so basically we are using those two methods to change states and display an indicator based on that state so we need to use a state.

We will use `[ActivityIndicator](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/activityindicator)` element from react-native to display the spinner!

```
 state={

 loading:false
}
```

Voila üí´

We still have many options and ability to do with WebView, for example, you can be integrated with the navigator of your app and make everything dynamic, I used webView in one of the applications I worked on, so when you click the thumbnail of a restaurant it redirects you to the restaurant gallery inside the WebView and here the WebView take a dynamic URL and that‚Äôs really useful because there was a web app do this job so I connected my React Native application with this web app through the WebView so I didn‚Äôt have to do the same twice¬†.
